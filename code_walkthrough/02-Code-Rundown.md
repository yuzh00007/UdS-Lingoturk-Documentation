# Quick Code Rundown

This section will quickly go high level over the HTML and JS files and point out
anything that you should know to start programming immediately after.

> Any additional notes, especially written for anyone who has never done web
> or front-end dev before will be written in these bars

## HTML 

LingoTurk experiments run everything on a single webpage, so only a single HTML
file exists per experiment. Every single "view" that the participant needs to
see on a web page will be pre-defined in this document. Depending on the logic
of the code and the Angular "ng-" built in directives, the web page will update
automatically to show the participants different materials or instructions.

> Even if you don't see it reflected on the webpage, the code exists. 
> If you were to open up the `Inspector` on an experiment, you can see
> all the HTML code there, commented out.
