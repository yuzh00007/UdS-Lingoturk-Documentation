# LingoTurk Documentation

The documents here will give you a general overview of Lingoturk and shows
you how to work with the platform. The instructions revolve around the 
Lingoturk UI and setting up experiments, focusing on what to do to get started
and what to do when finished with making an experiment. 
They also provide some tips and tricks with the development workflow. 

For a more serious deep dive and walkthrough of the code involved with
creating the experiments themselves, look at 
[the code walkthrough section](../code_walkthrough/README.md).

If this is your first time ever working with Lingoturk, it's recommended to 
go through these documents and follow along with the instructions on your own
local Lingoturk server.
