# LingoTurk Documentation

## Tutorials

### 1. [Lingoturk Introduction](lingoturk_introduction/README.md)

#### Who is this for?

Anyone planning to work with Lingoturk for the first time.
And any one who will be working with Lingoturk through the UI as a front end user.

#### What does this section cover?

This section covers the basics of how to do anything
within the platform. There is zero focus on code, just the platform itself.

Everything that you can do on the platform is covered with instructions and
picture examples. After finishing this section, a researcher can start running 
experiments on their own.


### 2. [Code Walkthrough](code_walkthrough/README.md)

** SECTION WIP **

#### Who is this for?

Any one who plans on creating their own experiments and modifying experiment types.

#### What does this section cover?

This section will go over how to take an empty or existing 
Specifically, it walks through the code and explains what is going on under the hood
with as much commentary as possible. 

The code overview is structured like a tutorial. We start with a blank minimal
experiment type and, over multiple steps, program in the functions required
for a specific experimental set up. By the end of this section, we'll have a 
fully functioning experiment. 

While there's an expectation that you know how to program already, 
there was an attempt to make the code explanations as beginner friendly as possible.
There are also many beginner notes scattered through out the documents in order 
to make this section as friendly as possible to anyone who
has never worked with front end development before. In fact, this section 
was started by someone who had zero UI dev experience before LingoTurk, so 
it's written from their perspective for their past self to use. 


## Further References

### Code How-Tos 

** SECTION WIP **

This is a list of possible things you may want to implement in your experiment
and contains code snippets that were previously created to help you get started. 

### Experiment Type Index

** SECTION WIP **

This is a list of experiment types that are currently available on Masses with 
their already existing functionality. Before you code an element from scratch,
double check this list - you may potentially be able to reuse a function from an
existing experiment.
