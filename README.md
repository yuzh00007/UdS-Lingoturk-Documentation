# LingoTurk Documentation

At the moment, I've split everything into three sections:

### 1. [Lingoturk Introduction](lingoturk_introduction/README.md)

This section should be the starting place for any one who is being introduced
to Lingoturk for the very first time. It covers the basics of how to do anything
within the platform. There is zero focus on code, just the platform itself.

Everything that you can do on the platform is covered with instructions and
picture examples. After finishing this section, a researcher can start running 
experiments on their own.

TODO: the working with media section still needs to be expanded greatly.


### 2. [Code Walkthrough](code_walkthrough/README.md)

** SECTION WIP **

While the introduction goes over what happens at the creation and publication
of an experiment, this section will go over how to go from creation to publication.
Specifically, it walks through the code and explains what is going on under the hood
with as much commentary as possible. 

The code overview is structured like a tutorial. We start with a blank minimal
experiment type and, over multiple steps, program in the functions required
for a specific experimental set up. By the end of this section, we'll have a 
fully functioning experiment. 

While there's an expectation that you know how to program already, 
there was an attempt to make the code explanations as beginner friendly as possible.
There are also many beginner notes scattered through out the documents in order 
to make this section as friendly as possible to anyone who
has never worked with front end development before. In fact, thi    s section 
was started by someone who had zero UI dev experience before LingoTurk, so 
it's written from their perspective for their past self to use. 

### 3. [previous_documentation](previous_documentation)

The two existing pieces of documentation (Google doc and Protocol) 
that existed prior to this documentation undertaking are placed here.

TODO: the Google doc should be reformatted into a FAQ here
