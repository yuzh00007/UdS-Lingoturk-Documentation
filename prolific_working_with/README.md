# Prolific

This section will cover the basics of working with Prolific. It assumes that you
already have a working, pretested experiment that is ready for crowdsourcing.

> Note: this README will likely not cover A LOT of the things that can be done
> with Prolific. It covers what is most relevant for HiWis who need to run experiments and
> students using Prolific to collect data for their thesis.
> 
> For more information, you can always refer to Prolific's own
> documentation: https://researcher-help.prolific.com/en/collections/1029284-getting-started

### What is Prolific?

Prolific is the crowdsourcing platform we use to collect participant data from around
the world. By creating projects on Prolific, we can redirect users from around to world 
to our Lingoturk hosted experiment instances.
