# Prolific Setup

## Signing Up

You will need a Prolific account - either with a personal email or a UdS email.
During sign up, choose "Collect Data" when asked how you will use Prolific.

Otherwise, signing up should be pretty straight forward. 

## Create a Workspace

Workspaces in Prolific are like folders in which you can create different projects and 
run different experiments. Prolific will automatically create one for you
called "My Workspace", but it's best to create a more descriptive
one to hold experiments for each separate group of studies. This allows you to better 
manage finances and collaborators. 

> For example, one could have the following workspaces
> 1. My MSc Thesis
> 2. Demberg-Pragmatics Studies
> 3. HCI Studies

## Create a Project

After creating a workspace, you will need to create a new Project. Each project
can hold multiple different types of studies. 

> For example, a single Project for a paper might have the following Projects:
> 1. Pretest
> 2. Experiment 1
> 3. Experiment 2
> 4. Experiment 3

Each Project could have studies with different settings and participant types, etc. 
This Workspace/Project structure is just an easy way to manage your experiments, 
especially if you plan on running a lot of them.
